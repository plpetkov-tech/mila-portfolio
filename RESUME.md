# Meelah's Professional Profile

## Professional Summary
I am Meelah, a UI/UX Designer with a unique blend of corporate experience and artistic talent. With 1.5 years of dedicated UI/UX training and practice, I combine my background in business administration, customer-focused roles, and lifelong artistic passion to create user-centered designs that balance aesthetics with functionality. My experience working across diverse corporate environments—from customer support to procurement—has equipped me with exceptional stakeholder communication skills and a deep understanding of business requirements that inform my design decisions.

## Design Philosophy
My approach to design is centered on three core principles: consistency, accessibility, and simplicity. I believe that consistent design elements build user trust, accessible interfaces ensure inclusivity, and minimalism eliminates confusion while enhancing usability. While I have a personal affinity for Scandinavian minimalism, neumorphic elements, and glassmorphic designs, I prioritize stakeholder requirements and user needs above personal preferences.

## Artistic Foundation
My journey as a designer began in early childhood, where I developed a passion for drawing and painting landscapes, flowers, animals, and portraits. This artistic foundation gives me a natural advantage in UI design, particularly in creating original visual elements and understanding color theory and composition. Today, I continue to develop these skills digitally using my Wacom tablet with Adobe Illustrator, bringing the freedom of traditional art to digital design.
