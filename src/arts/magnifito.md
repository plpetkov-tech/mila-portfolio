This banner was created for Magnifito, a marketing agency in Bulgaria, as part of their website production. The design combines their brand identity with a clean, professional workspace setting.

The composition features the agency's logo prominently displayed on a laptop screen, accompanied by a branded document outlining "15 Criteria Your Brand Should Cover" in Bulgarian. The checklist covers essential brand elements including website design, advertising, and social media presence.

The design uses a sophisticated color palette with purple brand elements against a clean white workspace, enhanced by natural elements like fresh flowers and warm lighting from a golden mug. This creates an approachable yet professional atmosphere that reflects the agency's commitment to comprehensive brand development.

The banner effectively communicates the agency's systematic approach to branding while maintaining visual appeal for their target Bulgarian market.
