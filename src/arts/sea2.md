This tranquil seascape was created as a commissioned piece and gifted to a local driving school. The painting captures a serene ocean scene during the golden hour, with gentle waves reflecting the soft light of a gradient sky.

The composition features a smooth transition from deep blue waters in the foreground to a sky that gradually shifts from blue to warm peachy-pink tones near the horizon. The subtle brushwork creates a sense of calm movement in the water, with delicate reflections that catch the ambient light.

The painting technique employs traditional oil painting methods, building layers to achieve the soft color transitions and luminous quality of the sky. The horizontal composition emphasizes the endless expanse of sea and sky, creating a meditative quality that works well in an educational environment.

Working with oils allowed for the smooth blending necessary to capture the ethereal quality of light on water, particularly the way the sky's colors are reflected and refracted by the gentle waves. The piece demonstrates how traditional painting techniques can create calming, contemplative spaces in unexpected settings.
