## Concept Overview
This packaging design is inspired by the soulful relaxing scene of a holiday by
the sea. For many, true relaxation is found at the shoreline - where the waves
gently crush into the sand and time seems to slow. The most magical moments
of this experience can be felt at sunrise and sunset, when the horizon blends
into a dreamy palette of soft lavender, deep purples, and different shades of
turquoise blues. The border between the sea and the sky is not clear as it is a
blended mixture of softness and endlessness. These scenes are emotionally
powerful. They leave lasting memories - moments that restore the soul and
have a healing power for our consciousness.

My illustration for this limited summer holiday edition of Johnnie Walker Black
Label captures exactly this feeling: the peace, the beauty and timeless feeling
when one watches the horizon where the sea meets the sky at sunset. The
taste of a sip of Johnnie Walker Black Label is the ultimate piece that could
enrich this emotional scene and intensify it into a complete sublime. Together -
the magical scene and the intense taste of Johnnie Walker offer a luxurious
delight, shareable moment of harmony and relish. Because happiness, after all,
is the one thing that grows when shared.
The other main aim of the concept is a deep commitment to sustainability and
environmentally conscious design.
The outer packaging is made from biodegradable, fully recyclable kraft carton,
printed with soy-based inks to minimise environmental impact. The bottle is
nested in a handwoven basket made of natural rattan - a rapidly renewable
material that requires minimal energy and no harmful chemicals in its
processing. This choice not only avoids plastic entirely but also ensures that
the basket is compostable and gentle on the environment. Over time, it
naturally breaks down, returning nutrients to the soil without leaving a trace of
toxicity.
A delicate macramé wrap, handmade from 100% organic cotton, gives the
ultimate accent for the beach-inspired aesthetic while remaining both
biodegradable and reusable. These design elements not only reduce the
product’s ecological footprint, but they also offer a tactile and visual
experience that reinforces the overall narrative - natural, gentle, and enduring.
The packaging is also designed for practical application and functionality. Its
lightweight structure and flat - pack form make it efficient for transportation
and storage, minimising both shipping costs and carbon emissions. The design
can be easily scaled for large-scale production using conventional
manufacturing methods. A flap-opening mechanism with a reusable cotton tie
ensures a secure but user-friendly unboxing experience. Additionally, both the
rattan basket and macramé wrap can be repurposed as home décor, allowing
the consumer to retain a piece of the experience long after the whiskey has
been enjoyed.
Visually, the design is an extension of the emotional story it tells. The
illustration on the box captures the transition between day and night - the
horizon where the soft purples of sunset fade into deep blue and turquoise sea,
highlighted by delicate silver wave accents. The color palette and handmade
textures evoke a sense of calm, freedom of the soul, and remarkable memory —
ideal for a summer holiday edition. Yet, the packaging still holds true to the
refined identity of Johnnie Walker Black Label, maintaining elegant structure,
and a premium feel throughout.
This holiday edition is more than just packaging. It is a memory, wrapped. It
invites the consumer not just to enjoy a fine whiskey, but to be transported to
the peaceful edge of the sea, where the sky meets the water and time stands
still. With each sip, a sense of calm returns — a moment of reflection, joy, and
beauty that can be felt, remembered, and shared.
