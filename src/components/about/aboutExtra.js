          I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration which provides me with a solid foundation in understanding business requirements. My technical certifications include Figma Essentials, Figma Advanced, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator. I've also completed specialized training in the Principles of UI & UX Design and HTML & CSS Fundamentals. My interest in psychology has led me to self-directed study of psychological principles that enhance user experience design. I continually develop my skills through online courses, industry workshops, and hands-on project experience to stay current with the latest design trends and technologies.
