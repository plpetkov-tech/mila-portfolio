            I dedicated the last 1.5 years exclusively to deep UI/UX training and practice, whereby I also draw Fine Arts drawings, Graphic design illustrations on my Wacom tablet and read user pshychology literature. I combine my background in business administration, customer-focused roles, interest in psychology and lifelong artistic passion for drawing to create user-centered designs that balance aesthetics with functionality. My experience working in diverse corporate environments, from customer support and B2B sales to procurement, has equipped me with strong stakeholder communication and soft skills and a deep understanding of business requirements that influence my design decisions.

          <p className="text-black opacity-70 font-normal mt-3 text-xs xxs:text-xs xs:text-xs sm:text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-lg">
            Always trying to follow the three core UI principles - Consistency, Accessibility and Simplicity. The UI of each platform has to be consistent in its design as this is the basic impression in users perception of the ptoduct. Accessibility has to be considered at each level of the UI, so the product can be used by everyone. The aesthetics of the product play a crucial role of the product's perception as it can lead to different emotions in the users. I try to keep the Minimalistic style in order to keep designs clean and simple. Even if I have my personal preferences for pastel color palettes and for Neumorphic and Glassmorphic design, I always prioritize stakeholer requirements and user needs above personal preferences.

            My journey as a designer began in early childhood, when I developed a passion for drawing and painting landscapes, flowers, animals, and portraits. Ever since my childhood I used to draw continiously with aquarel, oil and acrylic colors. This artistic personality gives me a natural advantage in UI design, particularly in creating original and beautiful visual elements and understanding color theory and composition. Today, I continue to develop these skills digitally using my Wacom tablet with Adobe Illustrator, bringing the freedom of drawing art on paper to digital design.

            My professional experience includes creating website banners and social media assets while providing UX consultation for website improvement at a digital marketing agency. During my UI education, I've created two completed platforms - mobile and web which include complete user flows, wireframes, and high-fidelity prototypes. My first project was an e-commerce platform, including original logo, icons, buttons, cards, and backgrounds. After that, during my Figma Advanced course, I created an event app with advanced animations and component interactions based on a given user personas needs. My corporate background as a Procurement Specialist at IBM, Account Manager and Inside Sales Representative at Cisco (for Cisco Webex) and other customer support roles has given me deep knowledge about business requirements and user needs.

            My corporate experience started during my University education. First I had a customer support role for an Online Payment platform that was followed by a technical game support position for a mobile gaming application. The role of a customer care specialist helped me to understand better the customer's requirements and struggle while using web based applications. I developped my empathy and soft skills while solving their issues. After my University graduation, I moved into the B2B business where I had Account Manager, Inside Sales (B2B Sales of Cisco Webex) and Procurement Specialist roles. In my role as a Procurement Specialist at IBM, I was responsible for processing hardware machine and parts requests from developers. My tasks included maintaining correspondence with vendors and requesting and analyzing quotеs. Before confirming an order, I was always verifying the existence of contractual agreements between the respective vendor and IBM. I was also involved in negotiating offers to ensure that IBM received the most competitive pricing.When necessary, I prepared, renewed, or amended contracts and contractual clauses in full compliance with IBM’s internal trade policies.I was specifically responsible for the German market, supporting IBM developers from German-speaking countries. I worked as part of an international team with colleagues from different countries, always adhering to corporate policies and procedures.

            The design softwares I work with are industry-standard design tools including Figma, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator, using my Wacom tablet for precision and creative details. In order to understand the structure of the platforms, the development of contstraints and the possibilities of the design better, I also completed courses for HTML and CSS fundamentals. Familiar with key UX research and design practices such as user interviews, A/B testing, persona creation, and user flow mapping, which I studied during UI/UX courses and explored further through self-learning.
