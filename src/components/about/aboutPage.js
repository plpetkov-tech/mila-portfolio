          <p className="text-black opacity-70 font-normal mt-3 text-xs xxs:text-xs xs:text-xs sm:text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-lg">
            My approach to design is centered on three core principles: consistency, accessibility, and simplicity. I believe that consistent design elements build user trust, accessible interfaces ensure inclusivity, and minimalism eliminates confusion while enhancing usability. While I have a personal affinity for Scandinavian minimalism, neumorphic elements, and glassmorphic designs, I prioritize stakeholder requirements and user needs above personal preferences.

            I specialize in a range of design styles to perfectly match project requirements. My personal affinity for Scandinavian minimalism shows in my clean, functional designs that eliminate clutter and prioritize usability. I'm also skilled in creating neumorphic interfaces that leverage subtle shadows and highlights for a tactile feel, and glassmorphic designs that use transparency and blur effects to create depth and visual hierarchy. While I have my aesthetic preferences, I always prioritize the project requirements and user needs when determining the most appropriate design approach.
